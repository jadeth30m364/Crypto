<p class=" serif">Bletchley Park was the site of the United Kingdom's main codebreaking team during World War
Two, and it is an estate in Bletchley, Buckinghamshire, England. The information gained by workers
at Bletchley Parks was very important for the Allied war effort. Codenamed Ultra, the high
level intelligence produced at Bletchley Parks provided lots of help to the Allied war effort. 
When the German U-boat submarine fleet sank merchant shipping in an attempt to starve Britain of supplies,
the Ulta was vital during the Battle of Atlantic. Sir Harry Hinsley, a Bletchley veteran and the offical historian of British Intelligence during the Second World War, said that Ultra shortened the war by two 
to four years. Without it, the outcome of the war would have been uncertain.

<p class="serif">Mavis Batey was an English coder breaker during World war 2. She was awarded the Veitch 
Memorial Medal in 1985, and made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1987.
She worked as an assistant to Dilly Knox, and was closely involved in the decryption effort
before the Battle of Matapan. When she was 19, she started working on the Italian Naval Enigma
machine. By late March of 1941, she effectively broke into their framework, deciphering a message
which said "Today's the day minus three". She worked three days and night to find out that 
the Italians were intending to assault the Royal Navy convoy transporting supplies from Cairo,
Egypt to Greece. The messages they decrypted provided a detailed plan of the Italian assault.
On December 1941, she broke a message between Belgrade and Berlin that enabled Knox's team 
to work out the wiring of the Abwehr Enigma, an enigma machine thought to be unbreakable.
She broke another Abwehr machine, the 666. This enabled the British to be able to read the 
Abwehr messages and confirm that the Germans believed the Double-cross Intelligence they 
were being fed by the double agents recruited by Britain as spies.

Margarat Rock was one of the few women who worked in Bletchley Park during World War 2, and 
she was able to decode the Enigma machine against German Army. Since she was classified by the 
official Secrets Act 1939, much of her work was not revealed. She was recruited to B.P.
in April 1940. She worked for Admiral Sir Hugh Sinclair, Head of Government Code. She was 
ranked one of the better workers on the Enigma machine.

<p class=" serif"> Joan Clarke was an English cryptanalyst and numismatist best known for her work as a code breaker
at Bletchley Parks during World War 2. Her role in the Enigma project that decrypted Nazi Germany's secret
communications earned her awards and citations like MBE. Additionally, she was denied a full 
degree because Cambridge University only awarded degrees to men till 1948. She only knew of one 
other female cryptologist that worked at Bletchley Parks. She worked at Hut, was the only female 
practitioner of Banburismus, which was a cryptanalytic process developed by Alan Turing which 
reduced the need for bombs, and electromagnetic devices as used by British cryptologists such as Weichman
and Turing to decipher German encrypted messages in Second World War. 
She was deputy head of Hut 8 in 1944. After the 
war, she worked for Government communications Headquarters (GCHQ), and assisted historians 
studying war, time code breaking at Bletchley Parks. Due to continuing secrecy among cryptanalysts,
the full extent of her accomplishments was unknown. In 1968, she was recognized by the 
British Numismatic Societ when she was awarded The Standard Saltus Gold Medal.
